## The process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Javascript
- React (Vite)
- API ([The Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/))

### What I learned

I learned how to use the power of React Router! A versatile package that really improves the React experience. I also learned how to type check with PropTypes, something I had not done before this project.

## Conclusion

I present to you a mock shopping cart website with the name of ParodyMart! The website is simple and features a home, shopping, and cart page. Thinking about my progress with this project I feel that I now know the importance of React and how versatile it can be. React Router is awesome and I look forward to using it in my future projects!
